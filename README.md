A simple and minimalist extension for Google Chrome Browser

# `CodeForces Rating Graph Hiding Extension`

## üìú Story Behind this Project

When I was new to Codeforces I used to feel very frustrated by Codeforces rating graph. It's good to see Codeforces rating go up and it's hard to see it go down. So I looked for a way, how to avoid seeing this rating graph. Then I started looking for any such browser extension. Then, not being able to find it, I took the initiative to make it myself.
